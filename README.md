# MVC
In a world where the user interface logic tends to change more often than the business logic, the desktop and Web developers needed a way of separating user interface functionality. The MVC pattern was their solution.
-	Model — the data layer, responsible for managing the business logic and handling network or database API.
-	View — the UI layer — a visualization of the data from the Model.
-	Controller — the logic layer, gets notified of the user’s behavior and updates the Model as needed.
